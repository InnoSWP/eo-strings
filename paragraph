\subsection{Functions in other languages}
A proper library is written with the experience of other languages in mind to avoid common mistakes. All the languages analyzed in this article have functions with different names but with the same result. It's called pizza language. Many libraries have a lot of functions that are rarely used. Either no one knows about them, or the result can be obtained in a more complicated way with a more popular function. This cannot be avoided in industrial and old languages, but the EO language has a strong academic foundation. An important task is to keep the purity and elegance of the language.
